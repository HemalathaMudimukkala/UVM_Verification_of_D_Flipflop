# UVM_Verification_of_D_Flipflop
This project showcases the verification of a D Flip-Flop sequential circuit using SystemVerilog and the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) framework. The design under test (DUT) is a simple D Flip-Flop that captures the input value (din) on the rising edge of the clock (clk), provided the reset (rst) is not asserted. The verification environment, developed entirely in UVM, includes key components such as a configuration class, transaction sequences, driver, monitor, and scoreboard. The environment ensures comprehensive coverage of the Flip-Flopâ€™s behavior across different scenarios, including reset conditions, valid data inputs, and randomized inputs. The driver applies the generated input transactions to the DUT, while the monitor captures the DUT's outputs and sends them to the scoreboard for comparison against expected results. This structured approach ensures thorough validation of the D Flip-Flop's functionality, demonstrating proficiency in both digital design and advanced verification methodologies.
